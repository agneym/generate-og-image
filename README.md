# Open Graph Image Generator

![](https://github.com/BoyWithSilverWings/generate-og-image/workflows/Run%20tests/badge.svg)

Generates open graph images for your blog with Github Actions.

This github action scans your PR for changes to `md` or `mdx` files, reads frontmatter configuration from them and generates images for your SEO.

If looks very bland without an image when you share the URL, but adding a cover pic with nothing do with your article also does not suit you well. Here is a Github Action based generator that got you covered.

In your action file:

```yml
name: "Generate OG Images"
on: pull_request

jobs:
  generate_og_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate OG Images
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Image
        uses: BoyWithSilverWings/generate-og-image@1.0.3
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
        with:
          path: src/images/post-images/
```

For configuring the parameters, add following fields to the frontmatter:

```md
---
ogImage:
  title: "Things you don't know"
  subtitle: "There must be something"
  imageUrl: "https://example.com/image-url.jpg"
  background: "yellow"
  fontColor: "rgb(0, 0, 0)"
  fontSize: "100%"
---
```

## Frontmatter Props

| ---------- | :-------------------------------------: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| title      |           Title in the image            |          |                                                                       |
| subtitle   |          Subtitle in the image          |          |                                                                       |
| imageUrl   |     The image thumbnail on the top      |          |                                                                       |
| background | Background color, gradient or image url |          |                                                                       |
| fontColor  |         any css supported color         |          |                                                                       |
| fontSize   |              the font size              |          |                                                                       |

Works only with Pull Requests and `md` and `mdx` files.

## Repository level Props

These are props that you can configure in the action file to customise the working.

| Props        |               Description                               | Required |
| ------------ | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :------: |
| path         |      Path to place the image URL in                     |   true   |
| commitMsg    |    Commit message when image is added                   |          |
| background   | Background color, gradient or image url                 |          |
| fontColor    |         any css supported color                         |          |
| fontSize     |              the font size                              |          |
| componentUrl | Web Component to be rendered for output.                |          |
| botComments  | Whether a comment with a preview image should be posted |

Frontmatter level props on a document always takes precedence over Repository level props.

## How do I customise the output?

1. **I need a gradient background**

   Just as in CSS your frontmatter or Repo level prop can contain:

   ```
   background: 'linear-gradient(to right, #ec008c, #fc6767)'
   ```

2. **What if I need an image as background?**

   Write the CSS for it.

   ```
   background: 'url(https://example.com/image.png)'
   ```

3. **What about font sizes?**

   you can customise the repository level or frontmatter `fontSize` props which defaults to 100%. The heading and paragraph font sizes vary depending on it.

   ```
   fontSize: 120%;
   ```

4. **I need an emoji instead of image**

   You can pass in the unicode representation of the emoji from the [List](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) in `imageUrl` prop.

5. **I need to format the title**

   The `title` prop supports markdown, feel _free_ to _use_ it.

6. **I don't want these preview image bot comments**

   the `botComments` repo prop should be set to `"no"`

### I need more customisation on the output.

The generator uses a web component to create the default output and provides a repository level prop to customise this web component.

The component currently being used is on [Github](https://github.com/BoyWithSilverWings/og-image-element) and published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agney/og-image-element). The default URL is from [Unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) with [https://unpkg.com/@agney/og-image-element@0.2.0](https://unpkg.com/@agney/og-image-element@0.2.0).

You can substitute the same with `componentUrl` input in your workflow file. For more info on creating this web component, visit [source](https://github.com/BoyWithSilverWings/generate-og-image/blob/304fd9aa0b21b01b0fdc8a3d1a63a19ffdc1840d/demo/test-file.jpg)
